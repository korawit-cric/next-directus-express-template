# Turborepo: NextJs + Vite + Express + Storybook Template + Directus

This is an official starter Turborepo with multiple meta-frameworks all working in harmony and sharing packages.

This example also shows how to use [Workspace Configurations](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/configuring-workspaces).

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages and apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `api`: an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server
- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `workshop`: Component documentation/workshop site with ðŸ“– [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) â€” UI component environment powered by Vite
- `directus`: 

- `@repo/eslint-config`: ESLint configurations used throughout the monorepo

- `@repo/logger`: isomorphic logger (a small wrapper around console.log)
- `@repo/cric-ui`: prebuilt component with tailwind and cn utilities
- `@repo/typescript-config`: tsconfig.json's used throughout the monorepo

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Start Docker Containers
